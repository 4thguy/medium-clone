Medium Clone
============

Hi, this is an extremely simple project that clones the look and feel of Medium. Check the demo out to see what the stylesheet can do.

Unless you're planning to alter the stylesheet in some manner, you only need the medium-clone.css and medium-clone.min.css files from the dist folder.

You can find out why I created this project [here](https://medium.com/@4thguy/50243c593bc1).
